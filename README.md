Live demo: https://mdesanker.github.io/calculator/

Calculator created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Calculator was designed with flexbox and styled to mimic an image of an old calculator found on google. This was good practice with positioning elements on a screen.

JavaScript was used to create the functionlity of the calculator. User can perform 4 basic operations. The calculator inputs are stored into an array. You cannot chain more than 2 operands. If user tries to do so, the result of the first operation is displayed on the screen and becomes the first operand in the next operation. 

Learned
- Using switch statement to call function from a string
- Creating a nodeList of all buttons, adding eventListener, and having program respond differently depending on class of button pressed
